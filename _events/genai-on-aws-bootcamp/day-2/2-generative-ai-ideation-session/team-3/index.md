## Solution

- Use of generative AI: generate data for training a model for fraud detection
  - Reason: there's only very small percentage of fradulous transactions, so there's a lack of training data.

## Feedback

- "This really cool - well done Team 3. Spot on. When to use GenAl, and when not to use it (not everything is GenAI)."
- "Generating synthetic data is a big use case."
