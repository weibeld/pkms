## Feedback

- "nice job, make sense to use Claude, not instant (don't have latency constraints), and langchain can help you orchestrate the summary first and then flashcards."
- "Yeah, I liked it too, I have the same comment, if you don't know take a look on Amazon Textract (https:// aws.amazon.com/pm/textract/) that helps to extract the text of PDFs, but the main part of the solution was spot on, congratulations to the team"
