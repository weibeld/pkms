title: Amazon CodeWhisperer
---

- Currently, the only advantage of CodeWhisperer over comparable tools (e.g. GitHub Copilot, Codeium) is the handling of AWS code (e.g. AWS SDKs and APIs) for which it has been especially trained
- Otherwise, CodeWhisperer is mostly inferior, e.g. restricted set of supported languages, no plugin for Vim/Neovim
- Vim/Neovim plugin may be in the making at AWS
