- [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)
  - Extension to PostgreSQL allowing PostgreSQL to be used as a vector database
  - Specialised for sparse vectors
    - Dense vectors are "compressed" vectors where dimensions get less clear and more generalised
  - Advantage of pgvector with respect to alternatives is that an existing PostgreSQL database can be reused as a vector database
    - Alternatives: [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/), [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)
- Lab: Generative AI Use Cases with Aurora PostgreSQL and pgvector
