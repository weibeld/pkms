- Amazon SageMaker example notebooks
  - https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples
  - https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
  - These notebooks are available as "SageMaker Examples" on an Amazon SageMaker [Notebook Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html)
    - It's [recommended](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebooks-comparison.html) to use [Studio Notebooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebooks.html) (from SageMaker Studio) instead of Notebook Instances (which are not in SageMaker Studio)
  - These are also similar (but not the same) notebooks that open in SageMaker Studio when clicking "Open notebook in Studio" on the details page of a foundational model in the SageMaker Console
